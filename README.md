# terminalmadness
*this is a basic game framework that renders a grid using vectors/arrays*
*resized accordingly to the terminal windows's size*
# how to use
currently its kind of broken so users have to edit the code instead until
i format the code (yes i know resizing crashes the whole program i will fix it when
i have enough time to spare)
